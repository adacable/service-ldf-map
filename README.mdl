The map and later schedule for LDF service design subfestival
## technologies

The product will be a one page static web app to mximise the ease of serving it with our resources, and to prevent sope creep. 

Compilation will be handled at the backend by guard, with the guard-copy guard-sass, sass and guard-haml, because these are the tools the dev likes, and they work well in this instance.

Frontend will be frameworkless js with jquery for ease of coding, and mapbox providing the maps for ease of use, good free plan and great customisability. 

Other technologies will be incorperated as nessecary. 

## roadmap
### current state

architechture and spec written


### initial release(minimal viable, yeah, you get the drift)

- load a set of events from a geojson file of events with locations
- from each geojson object build a description, cutymapper and google maps links, and place them into mapbox.

### second release

- searchable events
- individual links to events. 

### third release

- pulling data automatically from the google spreadhseet
- store a list of events the person has "marked" as wanting to attend in localstorage and the map would allow them to view by date and time as well.
